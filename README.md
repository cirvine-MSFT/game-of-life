# Game of Life

An interview-style Conway's Game of Life project designed to start small and grow over time.

## Project goals

- Model the rules of Conway's Game of Life clearly.
- Keep the implementation easy to extend for future interview prompts.
- Add tests and refactor as the project gains features.

## Current scope

This repository is intentionally runtime-neutral for now. The first implementation can choose the language, test framework, and interface that best fit the next exercise.

## Conway's Game of Life rules

For each generation:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

## Suggested next steps

1. Choose the initial language and test framework.
2. Add a small board representation.
3. Implement generation advancement.
4. Add tests for stable, oscillator, and edge-case patterns.
